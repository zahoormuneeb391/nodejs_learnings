   by simplifying package sharing and dependecy management.

**io.js was a fork of Node.js** created by developers who wanted faster updates and improvements.
The merger brougth io.js's community driven innovation back inot the main Node.js project.

The actual merger took place in Septemeber 2015, resulting in the **release of Node.js v4.0**. This
