## REPL in NodeJS (Read, Eval, Print, Loop)

## How REPL Works

1. Read
   The REPL reads the users input (a single line or multiple lines of code)
   and parses it into a data structure that the JavaScript engine can understand.

2. Eval (Evaluate)
   The parsed input is evaluated (executed) by the JS engine. If the input is a
   valid expression, the REPL computes the result.

3. Print
   The result of the evaluated expression is printed back to the console so the
   user can see the output.

4. Loop
   The process then loops back, waiting the next input, and continues unless the
   exit form the REPL environment
