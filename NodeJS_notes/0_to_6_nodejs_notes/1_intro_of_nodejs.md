## Introduction to NodeJS

> Open source, server-side **Javascript** runtime.
> Allows you to run **Javascript** on your **machine** or **servers**
> Built on the **V8 Javascript Engine** of **Chrome** for speed.
> Robust ecosystem with **npm**

## Open Source:

Source code of Nodejs is publicly available.

## Cross-Platform:

Nodejs can run on multiple OS like Windows, Mac and Linux.

## Javascript Runtime Environment:

Environment where your JavaScript code runs.
JavaScript typically runs in the browsers (Like Chrome or Firefox) to handle frontend tasks.
Thats why we can see the JS code in our browser.

## With NodeJS:

JavaScript can also runs outside the browsers, on the serevers.
Like we can interact with systems i.e

> File System (read/write files)
> Network (Handle HTTP requests)
> Database (connect to databases like MongoDB or MySQL)

## Why is NodeJS special as a Runtime ???

# V8 Engine:

NodeJS uses **Google Chorme's V8 engine** to compile JavaScript code into machine
code making it super and lightning fast.

# Built-in APIs:

NodeJS comes with **built-in APIs** (like fs for file system, http for servers) so
you can build powerful applications without extra libraries.

## Why do we need NodeJS ???

1. Single Language (JS) for Full Stack Development.
2. High Performance because of V8 it can handle thousand of simultaneous connections easily.
3. Event Driven and Non-Blocking I/O.

<!--
Unlike traditional servers that blocks a thread for each request, NodeJS uses an
asynchronous model, making it highly efficient for handling multiple tasks.
-->

4. Scalable for Modern Applications.

<!--
Ideal for real-time application like chat apps, streaming apps or online games.
 -->

## Where is NodeJS used ???

Example of companies using NodeJS:

1. Netflix (for faster streaming experiences)
2. LinkedIn (in Backend to handle massive amount of data)
3. PayPal (to handle secure transactions and ensure scalability)
4. Uber (for real-time driver and rider data syncing)
5. Trello (for managing async updates in real-time boards)

<!-- ! APIs in NodeJS -->

**NodeJS is mostly used for API development**
**API send and receive data b/w any two languages**
**After making API in nodejs it can be used in frontend or in mobile apps or desktop software**
**API moslty give response in JSON format and almost all the programming languages support JSON format of Data**

<!-- ! Is NodeJS a language or a framework ....? -->

NodeJS is not a programming language or a framework, but rather a JavaScript
runtime environment that allows developers to run JavaScript outside or a
browsers means on servers.
