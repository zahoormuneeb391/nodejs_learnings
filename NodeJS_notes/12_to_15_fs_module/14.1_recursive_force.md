<!--! Recursive and force  -->
# recursive
# true
  - Deletes directory + all inner files/folders.  
  - Useful for non-empty dirs.  
  - Risk: accidental full data loss.  
# false (default)
  - Deletes only if empty.  
  - Safer.  
  - Must delete inner files manually first.  


# force
# true 
  - Ignore errors (e.g., dir not found).  
  - Good for cleanup scripts.  
  - Risk: hides problems.  
# false (default) 
  - Throws error if issue.  
  - Safer, shows real issues.  
  - More error handling needed.  


# Best practice  
  - Use `recursive: true` when deleting non-empty folders.  
  - Keep `force: false` unless you want to ignore errors.
