# Node.js vs PHP/XAMPP Comparison

## Node.js

- **Server Requirement:** Developer must create HTTP server manually (`http` module or frameworks like Express).
- **HTTP Handling:** Manual routing and request/response handling needed.
- **Routing:** All routes must be defined by the developer (`if/else` or Express routes).
- **Flexibility:** Very high — full control over server behavior, middleware, and request handling.
- **Installation:** Requires Node.js runtime; frameworks like Express are optional.
- **Database Connection:** Developer manually connects to DB (MySQL, MongoDB, etc.).
- **Scalability:** Highly scalable due to non-blocking I/O, ideal for real-time apps.
- **Deployment / Hosting:** Node.js app must be hosted on a server (VPS, PaaS, or cloud service).
- **Learning Curve:** Steeper — understanding server concepts, routing, and async behavior is required.

## PHP + XAMPP/WAMP

- **Server Requirement:** Prebuilt server (Apache) handles HTTP requests automatically.
- **HTTP Handling:** Automatically handled by Apache; developer only writes PHP code.
- **Routing:** PHP scripts are executed based on URL; routing handled by Apache.
- **Flexibility:** Limited — predefined server behavior, less low-level control.
- **Installation:** XAMPP/WAMP bundle includes Apache, PHP, and MySQL.
- **Database Connection:** PHP code connects to DB; server manages request lifecycle.
- **Scalability:** Traditional blocking model; less efficient for large-scale real-time apps.
- **Deployment / Hosting:** Mostly used for local development; deployment usually on Apache server.
- **Learning Curve:** Easier — server setup is abstracted by XAMPP/WAMP.
